Under this project, the working principles and methods the BLAKE-256 and BLAKE2s hash functions were studied and analysed. Later, preimage attacks were mounted on the round-reduced(i.e. 1.5 and 2 rounds) versions of BLAKE-256 and BLAKE2s. Both the above-mentioned hash functions produce 256-bit hash values. BLAKE was one of the five finalists for the SHA-III standard in the NIST's hash function competition. BLAKE2 was later introduced as a faster successor of BLAKE. In this project, working methods of both the hash functions is explained with implementations in the C programming language.
